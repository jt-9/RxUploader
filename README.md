RxUploader for Android
=======

A reactive Uploader for [Android][1] using [RxJava][2] and [OkHttp][3]

![](docs/static/rxuploader_architecture.png)

Installation
=======
Add the following dependency to your project build.gradle file:
(note: Gradle is the only supported build configuration at this time)
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.jsaund:rxuploader:0.0.2'
}
```

Usage
=======
A new instance of the `UploadManager` can be constructed via the `UploadManager.Builder`.
```
final UploadManager uploadManager = UploadManager.builder()
    .withUploadDataStore(dataStore)
    .withUploadService(service)
    .withUploadErrorAdapter(errorAdapter)
    .build();
```

Clients must implement a `UploadService` and `UploadErrorAdapter`. Optionally, clients can implement the `UploadDataStore` or use a `SimpleUploadDataStore` which persists Jobs to SharedPreferences.

The `UploadService` defines the interface for the `UploadManager` to interact with the remote server responsible for accepting files to be uploaded.

The `UploadErrorAdapter` defines which exceptions can be retried and what `ErrorType` they map to.

The `UploadManager` provides methods to `enqueue` a new Job, subscribe to `status` updates, and `retry` failed Jobs.

See rxuploader-sample project for a complete example.
